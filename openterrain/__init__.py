def hillshade(elevation, azdeg=315, altdeg=45, vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, fraction=1.):
    """
    This is a slightly modified version of
    matplotlib.colors.LightSource.hillshade, modified to remove the contrast
    stretching (because that uses local min/max values).

    Calculates the illumination intensity for a surface using the defined
    azimuth and elevation for the light source.
    Imagine an artificial sun placed at infinity in some azimuth and
    elevation position illuminating our surface. The parts of the surface
    that slope toward the sun should brighten while those sides facing away
    should become darker.
    Parameters
    ----------
    elevation : array-like
        A 2d array (or equivalent) of the height values used to generate an
        illumination map
    azdeg : number, optional
        The azimuth (0-360, degrees clockwise from North) of the light
        source. Defaults to 315 degrees (from the northwest).
    altdeg : number, optional
        The altitude (0-90, degrees up from horizontal) of the light
        source.  Defaults to 45 degrees from horizontal.
    vert_exag : number, optional
        The amount to exaggerate the elevation values by when calculating
        illumination. This can be used either to correct for differences in
        units between the x-y coordinate system and the elevation
        coordinate system (e.g. decimal degrees vs meters) or to exaggerate
        or de-emphasize topographic effects.
    dx : number, optional
        The x-spacing (columns) of the input *elevation* grid.
    dy : number, optional
        The y-spacing (rows) of the input *elevation* grid.
    fraction : number, optional
        Increases or decreases the contrast of the hillshade.  Values
        greater than one will cause intermediate values to move closer to
        full illumination or shadow (and clipping any values that move
        beyond 0 or 1). Note that this is not visually or mathematically
        the same as vertical exaggeration.
    Returns
    -------
    intensity : ndarray
        A 2d array of illumination values between 0-1, where 0 is
        completely in shadow and 1 is completely illuminated.

    # counterclockwise from East (mathematical notation).

    # consistent to what `imshow` assumes, as well.

    # Calculate the intensity from the illumination angle
